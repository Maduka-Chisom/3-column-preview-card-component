## My process

- Read instructions
- Analyize design, observe document flow and element structure.
- Wrote the html code first
- Then applied styles in css
- Edited the README-template
- create repository and publish code on git
- submit assigment, share project and get feedback

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

i learnt about the <section> tag, it was stated that section can be used to create cards in html and also, i learnt that section can be nested inside a div.

example:

```html
<div class="container">
  <section class="product-card product-card--sedans">
    <img
      class="icon"
      src="./images/icon-sedans.svg"
      alt="A sedan product card"
    />
    <h1 class="product-heading">Sedans</h1>
    <p class="product-text">
      Choose a sedan for its affordability and excellent fuel economy. Ideal for
      cruising in the city or on your next road trip.
    </p>
    <a class="product-link product-link--sedans" href="#">Learn More</a>
  </section>
</div>
```

### Continued development

i intend on building more components, then webpages, websites using html, css and javascript and frontend tools.

### Useful resources
